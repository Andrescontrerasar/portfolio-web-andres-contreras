        I truly believe that project management is part of our everyday lives —
        we just need to pay attention to it. Whether we’re planning a trip,
        organizing a dinner, shopping, or fixing something at home, all of these
        everyday situations involve key project management skills: coordinating
        people, organizing tasks, managing time, staying on budget, and
        controlling costs.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        I’m passionate about giving my best in every project, whether it’s large
        or small. Through my work experience, studies, and personal life, I’ve
        developed qualities that are essential for leading projects and achieving
        great results.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        I aim to bring real value to every project through planning, coordination,
        strong communication, and continuous monitoring. I care about impact —
        not just progress — and I focus on building structure that helps people,
        clients, and ideas move forward with clarity and purpose.
